# crypto_arbitrage
## background
Arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the nearly simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the assets price between markets or exchanges. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, you capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas.

## objective
This analysis report presents a jupyter notebook that sorts through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. The notebook applies the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.
1. Collect the data.
2. Prepare the data.
3. Analyze the data.

High-level summary statistics and visualizations give rise to the conclusion of the anaysis:
It appears that there were more abitrage opportunities early on, but the opportunities phased out as time went on.  This is could be caused by more arbitrage participants entering trades as time went on or other industry factors that reduced costs and profitability.
